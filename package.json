This ecommerce website uses React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. It has a simple navigation menu, a home page, a product list page, and a cart page. The product list page displays a list of products with images, names, descriptions, and prices. The cart page displays the products in the cart with subtotal and a checkout button.

Note that this is a basic example and you will need to add more features, such as user authentication, payment gateway integration, and product management, to make it a fully functional ecommerce website.
